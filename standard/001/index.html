    <h2>Torch Placements</h2>

    <h3>Above ground</h3>
    <p>
      Any torch arrangements shall start at the corner of a chunk,
      such that it is the corner with the lowest X and Z coordinate.
    </p>
    <img src="corner.png" />
    <p><i>
      This image shows a torch placed in the corner of a chunk.
      (Use F3+G to show chunk boundaries). The blue, green and red symbol
      shows that the player is facing in the negative X and negative Z
      direction.
    </i></p>

    <h3>Strip Mines</h3>
    <p>
      Any torch placed within a strip mine MUST be situated on the LEFT
      hand side of the strip mine. Torches found on the right hand side
      means the player is travelling in the reverse direction.
    </p>

    <p><i>
      This image shows torches on the right hand side.
      Players whom encounter torches on the right can use this
      information to navigate towards the exit.
    </i></p>
    <p>
      It is recommended to place your torches every time the block light
      level reaches 2. This maximises torch efficiency, without reducing
      safety in the possibility of mob spawning.
