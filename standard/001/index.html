    <h2>Torch Placements</h2>

    <h3>Above ground</h3>
    <p>
      Any torch arrangements shall start at the corner of a chunk,
      such that it is the corner with the lowest X and Z coordinate.
    </p>

    <p><i>
      This image shows a torch placed in the corner of a chunk.
      (Use F3+G to show chunk boundaries). The blue, green and red symbol
      shows that the player is facing in the negative X and negative Z
      direction.
    </i></p>

    <h3>Strip Mines</h3>
    <p>
      When digging out a strip mine, all torches MUST be placed on the
      LEFT hand side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Torches found on the left hand side means the
      player is travelling in the forwards direction, whereas torches
      found on the right hand side means the player is travelling
      in the reverse direction.
    </p>

    <p><i>
      This image shows torches on the right hand side.
      Players whom encounter torches on the right can use this
      information to navigate towards the exit.
    </i></p>
    <p>
      It is recommended to place your torches every time the block light
      level reaches 2. This maximises torch efficiency, without reducing
      safety in the possibility of mob spawning.
